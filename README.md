This project utilizes a Django framework and a MySQL database. I used validations for the loginning in and registering and the appropriate error messages will show if information is not validated. The user will have a wishlist once logged in. He can create items to add to his wishlist and delete them, or he can add items from other user's wishlists. Templates are html with embedded Python, and the back end and database are Python.
